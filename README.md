## **Code Institute Hackathons**

I have participated in the following code institute hackathons. I found these to be a fabulous learning experience and really good fun. It was great to be able to collaborate with other developers as part of a team to produce a project within a set deadline. It has also been a great introduction to the use of the Agile methodology and to see it in action.
