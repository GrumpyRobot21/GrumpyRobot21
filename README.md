## **Code Institute Milestone Projects**

As part of my Code Institute Diploma I have created the following projects. These were challenging but gave me a great way to use the coding skills introduced throughout studies:

1.

## **Code Institute Hackathons**

I have participated in the following code institute hackathons. These were a fabulous learning experience and really good fun. It was great to be able to collaborate with other developers as part of a team to produce a project within a set deadline. It has also been a great introduction to the use of the Agile methodology, pull requests and merge conflicts.
